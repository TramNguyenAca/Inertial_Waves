# Welcome to experiments with Inertial_Waves!

This python code performs the inversion of solar differential rotation and viscosity presented in the scientific article

[*Linear toroidal-inertial waves on a differentially rotating sphere with application to helioseismology: Modeling, forward and inverse problems*](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.20488)

Authors: **Tram Thi Ngoc Nguyen**, Damien Fournier, Laurent Gizon, and Thorsten Hohage

To recreate the numerical results presented therein, open and run the Jupyter notebook

**inertial-main.ipynb**

The accompanying Python script

**inertial-functions.py**

contains all funtions needed for the main file, and should not be executed independently. 

This code is expected to work on the majority of architectures.
